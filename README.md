# Optimizing Asymmetric Binocular Rendering in VR Based on Color Sensitivity in Dominant and Non-Dominant Eyes Unity Package

## Note

Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are rapidly evolving technologies, capturing significant attention across various industries such as entertainment, scientific research, medicine, education, and more. The value of these technologies lies in their potential seamless immersion into daily life, allowing for unrestricted mobility and enhancing quality of life through portable devices. COVID-19 pandemic has been the acceleration point of the development of VR and AR industry, catalyzing the usage of VR collaboration platforms during lockdowns. This trend has expedited technology companies to intensify their commitment to developing VR and AR devices that are not only immersive but also suitable for everyday commercial use. 

Yet the development of VR and AR devices faces critical challenges, mainly in achieving smooth integration into daily life without compromising user comfort. Concerned upon overcoming these challenges is the creation of devices that are ergonomically optimized. This task involves designing headsets that are comfortable for prolonged use while presenting high-quality graphical performance. 

Achieving realistic and immersive visuals demands advanced hardware capabilities. That being said, sophisticated rendering techniques increase computational demands while enhancing user experience. This paradox, in turn, requires substantial power, often necessitating larger batteries to sustain performance over reasonable durations. The balance between device portability and power efficiency is thus a primary challenge. Foveated rendering is one of the innovative software-driven display technologies the industry is delving into in response. The main focus of these technologies is to determine the threshold at which users do not perceive degraded quality while the device optimizes energy usage. Building on previous work, scholars are examining color discrimination abilities to enhance rendering efficiency.

This study aims to enhance battery efficiency by rendering different chromaticities in each eye, examining the minimal color discrimination threshold between the dominant and non-dominant eyes.
